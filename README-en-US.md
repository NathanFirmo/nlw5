## Description

This chat project was developed in Node.js, during the fifth edition of [@rocketseat] NLW (https://github.com/Rocketseat).
TypeScript was used for the backend, while for the database, TypeORM was used with Sqlite. The connection between the chat users is made with WebSocket.

## Installation

Open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/NathanFirmo/support-chat.git
```

```
cd support-chat
```

```
yarn dev

```
After that, just access the [client page] (http: // localhost: 3333 /) and the [page attendant] (http: // localhost: 3333 / admin).
